                                                            EventFinder

Description:
************

EventFinder is a project that helps students find different events to attend on campus. The two main tasks that EventFinder addresses are the ability to browse through different events or information with arm movements, and the ability to curate a customized feed by selecting categories of interest.

Installation
************

To run EventFinder, you need to install its dependencies. Run the following command:
```
./run.sh
```

Constraints:
************

When using EventFinder, the user should stand approximately 1-2 meters away from the display. When moving their arm to trigger the actions on the page, the user should hold each position for about 5 seconds for it to work effectively (e.g., keep their arm in the upper right position to choose the upper right category).

My primary responsibility was to work on the carousel page. I did not have any prior experience with React, so I took the time to learn how to create a carousel and an event object model.
After learning, I started coding the front-end for the uncontrolled carousel. I created the event object model, which consisted of arrays of events for each category that could be rotated through depending on which category the user clicks.
To implement this model, I had to redo the uncontrolled carousel component to fit with it. This involved using a version of a hashmap function to achieve the desired functionality.
In addition to working on the carousel page, I aided in testing the display by being a test subject for the project and giving feedback on the usability. Finally, I wrote up the README document, which explains how to install dependencies and run the project, provides a brief description of the project, and includes a collaboration record that specifies what each team member contributed to the prototype.
